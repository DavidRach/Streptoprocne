## `Streptoprocne`: Ain't no such thing as bad weather, layer up wisely.

White-collared Swifts (**Streptoprocne zonaris**) are a large swift found widely across the neotropics.

In Chiapas where I grew up they would descend into the city after heavy rains in pursuit of insects. 

Thus a R package with functions aimed at web-scrapping weather and environmental data broadly to inform my own clothing choices gets the naming nod at this childhood memory.
